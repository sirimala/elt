            "passage": "The Opinion Pages | OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR<br> In India, Black Money Makes for Bad Policy<br> By KAUSHIK BASU NOV. 27, 2016<br> NEW DELHI — On Nov. 8, the Indian government announced an immediate ban on two major bills that account for the vast majority of all currency in circulation. Indians would have until the end of the year to change those notes for other bills, including newly minted ones.<br> On Wednesday, the government released via a smartphone app called “Narendra Modi,” named after the prime minister, the results of a survey purporting to show 90 percent support for its so-called demonetization policy.<br> The poll was rightly criticized. In the two weeks after the measure was announced, millions of Indians stricken with small panic rushed out to banks; A.T.M.s and tellers soon ran dry. Some 98 percent of all transactions in India, measured by volume, are conducted in cash.<br> Demonetization was ostensibly implemented to combat corruption, terrorism financing and inflation. But it was poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market, and it is likely to fail. So far its effects have been disastrous for the middle- and lower-middle classes, as well as the poor. And the worst may be yet to come.<br> India has a large amount of what is known as “black money,” meaning cash or any other form of wealth that has evaded taxation. According to a 2010 World Bank estimate, the most reliable available, the shadow economy in India makes up one-fifth of the country’s G.D.P. (A 2013 study by McKinsey, the consulting firm, puts the figure at more than one-quarter.)<br> Black money tends to exacerbate inequality because the biggest evasions occur at the top of the income spectrum. It also deprives the government of money to spend on infrastructure and public services like health care and education. According to the World Bank’s most recent estimate, from 2012,India’s tax-to-G.D.P. ratio is about 11 percent, compared with about 14 percent for Brazil, about 26 percent for South Africa and about 35 percent for Denmark.<br> The government’s wish to tackle these problems is laudable, but demonetization is a ham-fisted move that will put only a temporary dent in corruption, if even that, and is likely to rock the entire economy.<br> Many Indians have been scrambling to change their old notes, causing snaking queues in front of banks and desperation among the poor, many of whom have no bank account and live from cash earnings.<br> Anyone seeking to convert more than 250,000 rupees (about $3,650) must explain why they hold so much cash, or failing that, must pay a penalty. The requirement has already spawned a new black market to service people wishing to offload: Large amounts of illicit cash are broken into smaller blocks and deposited by teams of illegal couriers.<br> Demonetization is mostly hurting people who aren’t its intended targets. Because sellers of certain durables, such as jewelry and property, often insist on cash payments, many individuals who have no illegal money build up cash reserves over time. Relatively poor women stash away cash beyond their husbands’ reach, as savings for the children or the household.<br> Small hoarders often fear being questioned about the source of their money — they are accustomed to being harassed by tax collectors, among others — and may choose instead to forgo some of their savings.<br> People have also been skimping in response to the new policy, causing demand for certain basic goods to fall, which has hurt farmers and small producers and could eventually lead them to scale back on their activities.<br> And even more pain is around the corner. With so much money in circulation suddenly ceasing to be legal tender, India’s economic growth is bound to nose-dive. Another risk is that the Indian rupee could depreciate as a result of people and investors moving to more robust currencies.<br> The government’s demonetization dragnet will no doubt catch some illicit cash. Some people will turn in their black money and pay a penalty; others will destroy part of their illegal stashes in order not to draw attention to their businesses. But the overall benefits will be small and fleeting.<br> One reason is that the bulk of black money in India isn’t money at all: It’s held in gold and silver, real estate and overseas bank accounts. Another is that even if demonetization can flush out the black money that is held in cash, with no improvement in catching and punishing tax evaders, people with ill-gotten gains will simply start saving in the new bills currently being issued.<br> When the government announced demonetization, it also justified the measure as a way to curb terrorism financing that relies on counterfeit rupee notes, as well as to dampen inflation.<br> Both these justifications are flawed. Catching fake notes already in circulation neither helps trap the terrorists who minted them nor prevents more such money from being injected into the economy. It simply inconveniences the people who use it as legal tender, the vast majority of whom had no hand in its creation.<br> There also is no evidence that black money actually is more inflationary than white money; nor in theory should it be. Black money is just money held by people instead of the government. It’s an excessive money supply that tends to create inflation; whether that money is white or black makes little difference.<br> Demonetization may have been well-intentioned, but it was a major mistake. The government should reverse it. It could at least declare that 500 rupee notes, which many poorer people frequently use, are legal again.<br> And if the government really does want to limit the amount of black money in circulation, it would do better to move India toward becoming a more cashless society. About 53 percent of adult Indians have a bank account, but many signed up at the government’s initiative and so quite a few of the accounts are dormant. On the other hand, more than one billion people in India have a cellphone, and this could be tapped to encourage more active banking, in the form of mobile banking.<br> India’s push to issue a unique I.D. number to all Indians based on their biometric information is a major step in the right direction. More than one billion people have already been registered, according to the government, potentially enabling them to use an app to collect pensions, for example.<br> Tackling corruption also goes beyond currency, cash or even banking. It requires changing institutions and mind-sets, and carefully crafting policies that acknowledge the complexity of economic and social life. The government could start by increasing penalties for tax evasion and amending India’s outdated anti-graft laws.<br> In a country like India, where the illegal economy is so intimately intertwined with the mainstream economy, one inept government intervention against shadow activities can do a lot of harm to the vast majority, who are just trying to make a legitimate living.<br><br>",

            "passage": "ASIA PACIFIC <br><br> <br>Modi’s Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth <br><br> <br>MUMBAI, India — It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. <br>The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. <br>But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. <br>Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as 'black money,' flowing through the country’s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. <br>'Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,' said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children’s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, 'We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me.'<br>Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1,000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. <br>With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the long-term good. <br>That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for President-elect Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. <br>'Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,' Mr. Prasad said in an interview. 'Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle deep-rooted problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones.'<br>Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year’s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. <br>He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. 'Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,' Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. <br>'As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,' he said, referring to Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance movement, 'let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.'<br>Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. <br>'It’s a little bit crazy,' said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. 'When I first read the news, I couldn’t even figure out if it was true.'<br>The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency — more than 250,000 rupees, or about $3,670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. <br>Whether Mr. Modi’s far-reaching move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. <br>But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. <br>Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified goods-and-services tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India’s ossified and bureaucratic economy. <br>But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a short-term hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. <br>'If this move damages the economy, he’s in for a rough ride,' said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. <br>Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. 'You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,' he said. <br>Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country’s post-independent life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. <br>'In 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,' Mr. Pant said. 'He was the precursor to what’s happening in the West.'<br>Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country’s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. <br>But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. <br>Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified goods-and-services tax. <br>He cast the opposition as 'people who don’t want change, who don’t want reform,' Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. <br>But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. <br>Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1,000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. <br>He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. <br>'So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?' he asked. <br>Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. <br>'We can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight,' he said. <br>Surjit Bhalla, a New Delhi-based economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. <br>India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. <br>Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. <br>But doing so depends on Mr. Modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. <br>'So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,' Mr. Pant said. 'He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don’t know. There are so many unknowns.'<br><br>",
